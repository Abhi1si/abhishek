    "crop_title":"Wheat",
    "crop_description":"Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8 million hectares in the country. The production of wheat in the country has increased significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88 million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in 2004-05 has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity of wheat has been observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher area coverage is reported from MP in recent years.Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically hard, with high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2 million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards. However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium, mainly for processing of higher value/branded products.The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became independent in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the Indian population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling the needs of our people from many countries like USA under PL-480. \n \n The reasons of low production and productivity of Wheat at that time was \n \n  (a) the tall growing plant habit resulting in lodging, when grown under fertile soils. \n\n  (b) the poor tillering and low sink capacity of the varieties used. \n\n  (c) higher susceptibility to diseases. \n\n  (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo & photo variations, etc., resulting in poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a long exposure of plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility of increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions. As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country has completely changed.\n\n\n  In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat in the 'Green Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent in Wheat production. At present, country is producing much more excess Wheat than the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.Indian Wheat Growing ZonesThe entire wheat growing areas of the country has been categorized into 6 major zones as follows\nZones\tStates/Regions Covered\tApprox Area(million ha)\nNorthern Hill Zone(NHZ)\tHilly areas of J&K( except Jammu, Kathua and Samba districts), Himachal Pradesh ( except Una & Paonta valley),Uttarakhand(excluding Tarai region) & Sikkim\t0.8\nNorth Western Plains Zone(NWPZ)\tPunjab,Haryana,Western UP(except Jhansi Div),Rajasthan (excluding Kota & Udaipur div),Delhi, Tarai region of Uttarakhand, Una & Paonta valley of HP, Jammu,Samba & Kathua districts of J&K and Chandigarh.\t11.55\nNorth Eastern Plains Zone(NEPZ)\tEastern UP(28 dist),Bihar,Jharkhand,West Bengal,Assam, Odisha and other NE states (except Sikkim)\t10.5\nCentral Zone\tMP,Gujarat,Chattisgarh,Kota & Udaipur Div of Rajasthan & Jhansi Div of UP.\t5.2\nPeninsular Zone\tMaharashtra, Tamil Nadu(except Nilgiris & Palani Hills),Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh\t1.6\nSouthern Hill Zone(SHZ)\tNilgiris & Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu\t0.1\n \n \n Climate requirement :\n\n Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5 to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight. Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly a rabi (winter) season crop in India.SoilWheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.Fertilizer managementThe time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum productivity. The N was to be applied in two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around 150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to increase the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial for enhancing the productivity as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron (eastern and far eastern region) has also been realized.Nutrient managementWith intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has also become wide spread. The work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of sulphur has also been reported across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds and pulses etc. To realize the potential yield, strategies may include\nSite specific nutrient management for targeted yieldsIntegration of crop residues, bio fertilizers etc with inorganic fertilizationTillage techniques like FIRBS for increasing nutrient use efficienciesRemote sensing for efficient Nutrient managementNutrient management, straw quality vis-à-vis human and animal health\nMajor Wheat Producing States\n"

    "crop_title":"Rice",
    "crop_description":"Rice is considered a semi-aquatic plant, which means that it will require a flooded area or constant irrigation to grow. You can create the perfect environment for growing rice plants at home with this step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Plan around the rice-growing season. The optimal growing season for rice is from March through October, and the rice will take roughly six months to grow until it’s ready to be harvested.\n2. Purchase seeds from a local nursery or gardening store. You can find most common rice grain varieties at any local farming store or nursery. You’ll want at least 1–2 ounces of seeds.\n3. Soak the seeds. Fill a bucket with non-chlorinated water and immerse the seeds for 24–36 hours, or until germination begins with small rootlets growing out from the seed.\n4. Prepare your soil. Rice will grow best in semi-acidic soil that has very little drainage. Heavy clay or loam will retain water well, and you can use mulch, compost, or fertilizer-rich potting soil to create the right environment for growth.\n5. Prepare your area for planting. Rice will grow best in full sun and in a waterlogged environment similar to a flooded field. You can grow your rice in gallon buckets, a raised bed like a garden box, or you can create long troughs in the soil in your garden bed that can be filled with water. If you are planting your seeds in a bucket or box, make sure your soil level is at least 6 inches high.\n6. Plant the seeds. Plant your soaked and germinated seeds in the soil roughly a half-inch deep and with around 6 inches of space between each seed.\n7. Flood your area. Fill your growing area with water until the soil has saturated and there is at least 2 inches of water above the soil. Your growing area needs to be constantly wet for the seeds to grow, so make sure your water isn’t draining too quickly.\nHow to Care for Rice Grains\nThere are a few things you can do as your rice grows to keep it healthy:\n\nMake sure your soil is constantly wet. Check back regularly to add water to your soil to keep it flooded. Try to keep the water level at two inches above the soil when first growing and up to four inches when the rice stalks grow above six inches tall. Never let the soil dry out.\nTry to keep your seeds warm. If the nights get chilly, move your plants indoors or try covering them to trap warmth inside.\nRemove any weeds that appear. Your rice will be growing for many months and weeds might spring up during that time. Make sure to uproot any weeds to keep the area clear for growth.\n5 Tips for Harvesting Rice\nYou can harvest your homegrown rice crop by following these simple steps:\n\n1. Check that your rice is ready for harvest. Over the course of four to six months after first planting, the rice may have grown to around 3–4 feet tall, and sometimes higher. You will know it’s ready for harvest when the rice grains at the top of the stalk, called the seedheads, are no longer green and have turned a golden brown.\n2. Cut and dry the stalks. Cut the stalks at the top, right below where the clusters of rice grains (called the panicles) are located. Place these in the sun and allow them to dry for one to two weeks, or until they are completely dried out.\n3. Remove the grains from the cluster. In rice production, the step when you remove grains from the cluster is called threshing. You can remove each grain individually, or a faster method is to place the panicle cluster in a bag and beat them against a wall or hard surface until they separate and collect in the bag.\n4. Roast in the oven. Place the grains on a baking sheet. Roast at 180°F for at least an hour, or until they turn a darker golden brown. Let them cool afterward.\n5. Remove the husks. This step is called hulling, in which you remove the grain from their outer husks. You can rub them between your hands or use a mortar and pestle to grind and separate them. You will now have your own rice grains similar to what you would find in a grocery store. "

    "crop_title":"Barley",
    "crop_description":"Barley Climate Requirements Barley can be cultivated as both a summer crop or a winter crop. Both tropical and subtropical climates are suitable for growing it. The crop needs temperatures of 12 to 15 °C for growth and 30 to 32 °C for maturity. At any stage of growth, the crop is particularly sensitive to frost. Any occurrence of frost during the blossoming period might significantly reduce productivity. Drought- and heat-tolerant barley crops can endure harsh conditions. Barley Soil RequirementsBarley is mostly cultivated in sandy to moderately heavy loam soils. Therefore, the soil of Indo-Gangetic plains having neutral to saline reaction and medium fertility are the most suitable soil types for barley cultivation. Barley crops can be cultivated in saline, sodic and lighter soils too. Soil acidity impairs the root growth of barley crops hence acidic soils are not suitable for barley cultivation.Barley Farming Techniques \n \n Barley requires two to three cultivator ploughings, with each ploughing being followed by planking. Row spacing should be 22.5 cm for irrigation dependent lands and 22.5 to 25 cm for rain-fed lands. In an irrigation setting, the required sowing depth is 5 cm; in a rainfed situation, it is 6 to 8 cm. The main techniques for sowing seeds are drilling, broadcasting, and dropping. Barley can tolerate droughts quite effectively because it is a rabi crop. As a result, barley crops need less irrigation and have less access to water\n\n Barley Physiology The stems are upright, thick, tufted, and reach a height of 60 to 120 centimetres. It has few alternately arranged leaves. Near the spike is the upper leaf. Smooth and striated describe the sheath. Large auricles that frequently clasp or overlap are present in barley. The ligules are thin, membrane-like structures. \n \n Barley Crop Development \n\n The rate of development of barley is largely guided by variety selection and sowing date. Developmental stages differ in their impact on harvestable yield. The harvestable yield is more impacted by some growth phases than others. Management should promote growth in the stages that have the greatest impact on yield, particularly ear number. Compared to winter barley crops, spring barley crops go through the growth phases far more quickly. Ten developmental phases can be used to explain the life cycle of a barley plant. With the following key growth stages in mind, management decisions can be made more effectively "

    "crop_title":"Sugarcane",
    "crop_description":"Sugar Cane Growing Conditions \n\n Is sugar cane easy to grow? Yes, it is simple to propagate and grow this crop in general. Still, productive cultivation demands optimum growing conditions for sugar cane. The plant needs a high level of solar radiation and heat to flourish. Active hydration is another requirement for sugar cane growing. Last but not least, the soil should have good aeration, drainage, and a pH level ranging from 5 to 8.5. Each of these growing conditions requires more detailed consideration \n\n Temperature And Sunlight \n\n For most of its life cycle, the optimum growing temperature for sugar cane is around 32°C (90°F). After the plant grows mature, slightly lower temperatures help to increase the amount of sugar in it. Frost is prohibited for the crop, regardless of plant growth stages. Furthermore, sugar cane needs a lot of sunlight; if plants grow in a shaded field, even at the right temperature, they will suffer. \n\n Since temperature is a critical factor in growing sugar cane, choosing a field with a favorable temperature regime is necessary. EOSDA Crop Monitoring provides historical data on daily temperatures and a sum of active temperatures, allowing farmers to easily assess the potential of a single field or the region as a whole to grow a plentiful harvest. Understanding a field’s microclimate and history of temperature fluctuations gives the ability to quickly determine whether this area is suitable for growing sugar cane. After selecting the field, you can use temperature graphs to follow the trends and plan the growing period to make the most of the local weather conditions. \n\n Water And Humidity \n\n Keeping an optimal soil moisture level is just as important as light and warmth to grow healthy crops and obtain a high yield. During the growing season, the water requirement for sugar cane cultivation is 1500-2500 mm of rainfall (on average 25-50 mm per week). The preferred relative humidity on sugar cane growth is at least 50%. Farmers should not expect high yields if there is a lack of moisture since:the plant begins to dry out;the crop is growing slower;the sugar level decreases.As a result, if there isn’t enough rain in your area to grow crops, you’ll have to maintain the irrigation system.\n Reduced hydration will be a good solution at the end of the sugar cane growing cycle when you intend to harvest mature stems. During a drawn-out dry period, crops grow slower and produce more sugar in their stalks’ bottoms.\n At the same time, excessive moisture interferes with plants’ ability to grow, resulting in lower sugar levels, fungal diseases, and rot. Sugar cane should therefore be watered regularly and have well-drained soil during heavy rains.\n\n It is preferable to choose a field with sufficient moisture right away to avoid spending extra money on irrigation in the future. Historical precipitation data on the EOSDA Crop Monitoring platform will be beneficial in selecting the appropriate field for growing the crop. You can easily understand the precipitation trend on a separate field using data from the daily and accumulated precipitation graphs. This information helps to estimate and plan irrigation works required when natural precipitation alone can not suffice to meet the needs of growing sugar cane."

    "crop_title":"Groundnut",
    "crop_description":"Technology\n \nFinance\n Business\n Ecosystem \n Information Desk \n Online Services \n  Groundnut \n]n Introduction \n\n Groundnut, popularly known as the peanut is a leguminous crop cultivated for edible purposes. It is found exclusively in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is sometimes considered as a grain legume because the seed can produce oil and the crop is categorized as an oil crop. The oil content in the seed is estimated to be around 44-50%. The useful part or the part of economical importance within the crop grows under the ground as pods. These crops contain nitrogen fixing bacteria in their roots and that is the reason behind their low nitrogen fertilizer requirement. The cultivation of groundnut began from a hybrid of two different species of groundnuts found in the wild. They are A. duranensis and A. ipaensis. \n\n Major uses of groundnuts are found in soap making, cosmetics, lubricant industries, etc. The cake of groundnut is used for manufacturing artificial fiber. The green or dried leaves of the groundnut crops are called haulms and are used as livestock feed. The shell of the ground nut is used for manufacturing coarse boards, corks etc. This groundnut farming project report highlights the details about the farming techniques and at the end one can find the details about the cost of groundnut farming and the profit associated with 1 hectare of land.\n\n Scope and Importance of Groundnut Farming\n\n Among the oilseed crops grown in India, groundnut holds the first place. The annual production of groundnuts is around 7180.5 thousand tonnes approximately and 9 states are considered to contribute more than 100 thousand tonnes each. The major groundnut producing states in India are Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Telangana. Groundnut farming in India is done in 85 lakh hectares of land approximately and highest productivity is from the state of Tamil Nadu. Oil seeds in India definitely contribute to the agricultural economy, but they are only next to food grains in both value and production. The importance of edible oil in one's daily diet has resulted in increased demand for groundnut production. It is estimated that there would be further increase in consumption levels owing to enhanced income and population. Currently the production doesn't satisfy the demand and oil is being imported from other countries. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase the area under production for groundnuts so that many by-products manufactured from these could be made available. Groundnut farming in India is also expected to improve income opportunities for the tribal population. \n\n Cultivars/Varieties of Groundnut \n\n All the varieties of groundnut can be divided into three main subcategories namely; the bunch or the Spanish variety, the semi-spreading or Virginia bunch variety and the spreading or Virginia runner variety\n\n Bunch variety \n   Plants are erect\n Light green foliage\n •  Pods are produced in clusters\n •  Seeds are round, plump and non-dormant\n •  Seed colour is light rose]n •  Examples of this variety are Ah.32, Junagadh-II, GAUG-1, Kadiri-71.1, TMV-2, pol.1. pol.2, AK.12-24, Kopergoan-3 etc.\n\n Plant and Produce Properties \n Groundnut is considered to be a self pollinated crop, which can grow to a maximum height of 30 to 50 cm. The leaves of the plant are opposite and pinnate. They have four leaflets, each 1-7 cm long and 1-3 cm broad. The colour of groundnut plant flower is yellowish orange with red veins, generally grown in clusters and last for one day. The pods of peanut or groundnut grow underground and this feature is termed as geocarpy. The base of the ovary has a short stalk which elongates upon fertilization and forms a thread like structure called the peg. The peg grows inside the soil and the tip of the ovary develops into a peanut pod. The average length of a pod is 3-7 cm and may contain 1 to 4 seeds. The groundnut has 5 parts; they are shell, cotyledons, seed coat, radical and plumule.\n•  Mono and polysaturated fat made up of oleic and linoleic acid\n •  Proteins like arachin and conarachin\n •  Have low carbs and high fibre content\n •  Contain vitamins and minerals like biotin, copper, niacin, folate, manganese, vitamin E, thiamin, phosphorous, magnesium. \n Soil and Climatic Conditions for Groundnut Farming\n\n Groundnut plants need well drained sandy loam or clay loam soil for better performance. The soil should be deep and the pH of the soil should be around 5.5 to 7 with high fertility index. It is observed that heavy soil is unsuitable for cultivation because of difficulty in harvesting and pod loss. The soil should not be saline in nature because these crops are sensitive to salt. The soil for groundnut farming should not have stones and clay otherwise the yield would be affected. The temperature of the area should be around 27-30˚C for good germination and growth. The minimum annual rainfall required for the crops is in between 450 to 1250 mm. High altitudes, cold and frost are not suitable for groundnut farming. Exclusively long warm climate is good for cultivating groundnuts.\n \n Land Preparation and Planting for Groundnut\n All the previous crop residues and weeds should be removed and first ploughing to a depth of 15-20 cm should be done. This should be followed by 2-4 cycles of disk harrowing for getting a fine tilth of the soil. There are three systems developed for sowing groundnuts; the flat surface system, the broad bed-furrow system and the ridge-furrow system. The advantage of the broad bed furrow system is that it helps in proper draining of water, retains soil moisture, provides aeration to the soil and facilitates for intercultural activities\n\n Groundnuts are propagated through seeds. The seeds should be shelled just two weeks before planting. Groundnut seeds are either grown in the nursery, then transplanted to the main area or they have directly sown in the main field. The seeds are sensitive to physical damage so they should be handled carefully. It is important to note that split or damaged kernels will never germinate, so high quality seed should be procured for planting. The seeds for planting should have been naturally dried. If naturally dried seed are not available then, artificially conditioned seeds could be used, but excess heat application to dry the seeds can impair their germination property. Seeds dried under the sun are also considered to have poor germination. ]n \n Manure and Fertilizer Requirements for Groundnut Farming \n\n Residual soil fertility is essential while cultivating groundnuts. This is obtained by growing non-leguminous crops prior to groundnuts and fertilizing them properly with potassium and phosphorous content. The soil is tested and then required amount of fertilizers are added, but the general recommendations for groundnut crops are FYM @ 10 to 12 tonnes per hectare should be supplied to the soil 25-30 days before sowing. The plants may need micronutrients like nitrogen @ 8-20 kg, phosphorous @ 16-80 kg and potassium @ 1-75 kg per hectare of land as a basal application. Calcium helps in good seed development in groundnut plants and is supplied during the flowering stage @ 200-400 kg per hectare.\n \n Other than these the crops may need micronutrients like boron @ 3-4kh/ha during land preparation, zinc @ 10-20 kg/ha once in three years during soil preparation, sulphur and iron.\n \n Irrigation Facilities\n \n The period from flower development to pod formation needs a moist upper soil surface for a better yield. Improper water supply can reduce the growth rate of the crops, reduce the pod development and pod yield. The main idea of irrigation is to keep the soil surface moist without water-logging problems. If the crops are grown in a rain fed region, then there should be proper arrangement for drainage such that excess water doesn't stagnate in the field. If any extra irrigation is required it should be given only at flowering, pegging and seed development stages.\n \n If the crops are grown as Rabi or summer crops, then one should depend on irrigation. The total amount of water required by a groundnut crop is around 600-650 mm. Generally the crop should have 2-3 weeks of moisture stress which should be followed by frequent irrigation; doing so helps the crops flower profusely and have a uniform pod maturity. At different stages like seed development, pod formation and pegging light irrigation is given. When the crops have grown completely and are nearing maturity, irrigation should be reduced otherwise there is a risk of diseases. Flood irrigation is not suitable for groundnut plants instead sprinkler irrigation should be provided. \n control in Groundnut Farming  \n\n the major diseases found in groundnut crops are rust, early and late leaf spots, collar rot, aflatoxins and peanut bud and stem necrosis. These can be controlled by using disease resistant varieties, practicing proper cultural methods, using chemical formulations and biological measures.\n\n The major insect pests that infest the groundnut crops are tobacco caterpillar, gram pod borer, red hairy caterpillar, etc. Some integrated pest management ways to control the pests are growing resistant varieties of crop, growing trap crops like sunflower and castor bean on the borders of the farm, removing the eggs of insect pests manually, allowing birds to feed on the larvae of insects, applying neem seed oil or powder. There are also chemical insecticides and pesticides available in the market to control these pests.\n \n Some other pests found in groundnut crops are leaf minor, aphids, thrips, jassids, white grub and termites.\n\n Harvesting and Yield of Groundnut Farming\n \n Groundnut crops are considered to be indeterminate crops and the pod maturity is not uniform. For best harvest the farmer should observe the farm regularly. Every cultivar has a different maturity period and the indications of maturity are defined by pod colour, seed colour, leaves and prevailing weather conditions. Inner walls of the pod appear dark brown and if 75% of the pods show this then it is understood that the crops are ready to harvest. The seed inside the pod is white when young and changes to pink colour upon maturity. The leaves of the crop turn yellow and become dry at the tips indicating maturity of the crops.Harvesting can be done either mechanically or manually. Manual harvest should be done carefully, otherwise there is a risk of destroying the pods or losing them in the soil. A blade is used to sever the taproots below the soil to a depth of 10 to 15 cm. They are then collected and stacked in bunches. For bunch type groundnuts pulling them from the soil is the best method, whereas for spreading type groundnut plants blade harrow is used. The collected bunches are left for four or five weeks before being picked.The average yield of spreading type groundnut crops is estimated to be 1500 to 200 kg/ha and that of bunch type groundnut is expected to be 1000 to 1500 kg/ha."

    "crop_title":"Bajra",
    "crop_description":"Bajra Climate Requirements\n Bajra grows very well in dry and warm climatic regions, and it is a drought – tolerant crop that quite low annual rainfall of 40 cm to 60 cm. The ideal temperature range for Bajra cultivation is 20°C to 30°C. During its vegetative growth, moist weather is beneficial. Bajra is grown as a Kharif crop in North India and as a summer crop in some southern areas that receive irrigation. Bajra is also grown as winter crop in some regions within India.\n\n\n Bajra Soil Requirements\n\n\n Bajra can be cultivated in a variety of soil types. It does, however, thrive best in black cotton soils and sandy loam soils with good drainage. This crop does not thrive in acidic or waterlogged soils. Hence it is avoided to be cultivated in saturated soils. It grows well in soils with slighltly high pH (or high salinity). Bajra can be grown in areas where other cereal crops, such as wheat or maize, would fail.\n\n Bajra Farming Techniques\n\n There are three methods for sowing pearl bajra: on a flat surface,with a ridge and furrow system,with a broad – bed and furrow system.The seed should be planted at a depth of 2.5 cm  –  3 cm. In the north and central parts of the country, sowing of kharif pearl bajra should begin with the onset of monsoon, i.e. the first two weeks of July. In Tamil Nadu, the rabi season begins in the first two weeks of October. If there is a population gap, fill it by transplanting seedlings after 2 – 3 weeks of sowing. Dry sowing before the first monsoon rains is recommended in Maharashtra’s Marathwada region. Summer pearl bajra should be sown from the 4th to the 5th Standard Meteorological Week (SMW), or from the last week of January to the first week of February, to maximise production in zone B. Pearl bajra should be planted in rows 60 cm apart in the arid – western plains of Rajasthan, Haryana, and Kutch in Gujarat (A1 zone), with a low plant population of 1.00 to 1.25 lac/ha. For areas receiving more than 450 mm of rainfall (zones A and B), the crop should be planted at 45 x 10 – 15 cm spacing with a plant population of 1.75 to 2.0 lakhs/ha. For the crop, the seed rate should be 3 to 4 kg/ha in order to achieve the required plant stand.\n\n Bajra Physiology\n \n Bajras are typically annuals that grow to be 30 to 130 cm (1 to 4 feet) tall, with the exception of pearl bajra (Pennisetum glaucum), which has stalks that grow to be 1.5 to 3 metres (5 to 10 feet) tall and 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick. The inflorescences can be spikes or racemes with flowers on stalks of roughly equal length along an extended axis, or panicles with closely packed clusters of small florets. Except for pearl bajra, seeds are still enclosed in hulls after threshing. Hulled seeds are typically creamy white in colour.\n\n Bajra Crop Development\n\n Pearl bajra plant growth and development can be categorised into three major stages: \n Growth Stage 1: During this phase, seedling establishment occurs, as well as root, leaf, and tiller development. Panicle initiation is also underway.\n Growth Stage 2: During this phase, all leaves lengthen, all tillers emerge, floral initiation in tillers occurs, and the stem lengthens. This phase is characterised by panicle elongation and the formation of floral parts. The appearance of stigmas on the panicle signals the end of this stage.\n Growth Stage 3: This stage begins with floret fertilisation and lasts until the plant reaches maturity. The accumulation of dry matter occurs primarily in grain formation and, to a lesser extent, in the expansion of tiller stems and leaves. The development of a dark layer at the bottom of the grain indicates physiological maturity at the end of this phase.\n\n Bajra Crop Diseases \n\n Downy mildew: \n\n The disease is distinguished by pale, chlorotic streaks that extend from the base to the tip of the leaves. The leaf streaks turn brown as the disease progresses, and the leaves become shredded longitudinally. Downy fungal growth can be seen on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves in severe infections. The rainy and humid environment promotes the rapid growth of fungal pathogens. Infected plants do not form ears, or if they do, they are malformed to green leafy structures. The entire ear can be converted into a leafy structure.
